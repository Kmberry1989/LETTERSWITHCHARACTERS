/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Letters with Characters application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a secure, user-centric data model. It enforces strict
 * ownership for user-specific data and uses a shared access model for collaborative
 * game data. Public read access is granted for certain collections, while
 * writes are always carefully controlled.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user profile data. Only the authenticated user
 *   can read or write their own profile.
 * - /avatars/{avatarId}: Stores user avatars.  For simplicity, assume it's private to the user that created it.
 * - /themes/{themeId}: Stores game themes. Publicly readable, but only admins can
 *   create, update, or delete themes.
 * - /games/{gameId}: Stores game instances. Access is controlled via a "members"
 *   map on the document, where each key is a user ID and the value is their role
 *   in the game (e.g., 'player').
 * - /leaderboard/{leaderboardEntryId}: Stores leaderboard entries. Publicly readable.
 * - /stickers/{stickerId}: Stores sticker information. Publicly readable.
 * - /minigame_scores/{minigameScoreId}: Stores minigame scores. Publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Listing Disabled: The ruleset explicitly forbids listing all users.
 * - Ownership Model: User-specific data is protected by path-based ownership
 *   (e.g., /users/{userId}). Only the authenticated user with a matching UID
 *   can access the data.
 * - Shared Access: Collaborative access to game data is managed using a "members"
 *   map on each game document. This map defines the roles and permissions of
 *   each user within the game.
 * - Public Read, Restricted Write: Certain collections, such as themes and
 *   stickers, are publicly readable but only writable by authorized users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Game Documents: The `playerIds` array within each game document is denormalized
 *   to enable efficient querying of games a user is participating in.
